# E-Commerce Project 
using  ASP.NET Core MVC this is a comprehensive web application that aims to provide a robust, scalable, and highly customizable solution for building modern web applications. Leveraging the power of the ASP.NET Core framework, this project incorporates the latest features and enhancements to deliver an exceptional development experience including :
  * MVC Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and facilitates modular development. This allows developers to work on different aspects of the application independently, improving code maintainability and reusability.
  *  Razor Pages: this project utilizes Razor Pages, a new feature introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0, which simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages. With Razor Pages, developers can build cleaner and more expressive code by combining HTML markup, C# logic, and ASP.NET Core features seamlessly.
  * Entity Framework Core: The project integrates Entity Framework Core, a widely acclaimed Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. This powerful tool simplifies database operations by providing a high-level abstraction layer and supporting multiple database providers. With Entity Framework Core, developers can focus on business logic rather than low-level database access.
  * Authentication and Authorization: incorporates robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure access to sensitive resources. It provides support for various authentication methods, including OAuth, OpenID Connect, and custom authentication schemes. Flexible role-based authorization enables fine-grained access control within the application.
  * Extensibility and Customization: is highly extensible and customizable, enabling developers to tailor the application to their specific requirements. The project promotes the development of reusable components and follows best practices to ensure clean and maintainable code.
